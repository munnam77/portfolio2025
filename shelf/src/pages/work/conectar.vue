      Conectar is an e-learning platform that connects Russians looking to learn
      English to professional native English speakers. We had to bring the
      entire classroom experience to the web and make it feel as immersive as
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      To achieve that, we needed to build multiple apps into the system like
      comms (video, audio, messagging), a scheduling system (for appointments)
      etc so I joined the company as a Frontend Engineer to build these
      products.

    <p>
      User experience was quite critical for a learning platform so I got a
      professional to whip up a new identity and mockups, drafted a

        >proposal</a
      >, based on that I built the design system and a brand new marketing site
      following those guidelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      I designed all the UIs on the dashboard integrating REST APIs and built
      the front-end of major apps from the ground up like the messaging system
      which was based off of the API from our Rails backend. It was quite
      challenging integrating all these features while keeping an eye out for
      performance and usability. There were back-and-forths but eventually it
      was stable and had a bunch of the core features of Facebook Messenger
      which was really beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also worked with a colleague to build an appointment scheduling system
      for the product then went ahead to work on the classroom app which had
      lots of interesting features like a customizable realtime whiteboard built
      totally from scratch, video and audio comms and other tools to facilitate
      seamless tutor-student interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project was huge and housed hundreds of thousands of lines of code
      powered by multiple technologies like React, Rails, Sass, Redux,
      Webpacker, GoLang, Java etc and we often had to re-evaluate strategies
      regarding certain topics like state management, performance and
      development workflow. I was able to work across different segments from
      design to DevOps to strategy and implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was the Lead Frontend engineer so I got to work with other engineers and
      contractors on various tools. It certainly was a great learning
      experience. Unfortunately, the product hasn't made it yet to the real
      world and I absolutely hope that it does someday.

      Design work was done by my friend,

      with a little assist from me. He's absolutely talented and currently
      available for hire.
