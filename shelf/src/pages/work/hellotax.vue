      The company already had a functioning web app but needed a professional to
      create an entirely new experience with the latest technologies to leverage
      speed and provide an optimal user experience as their customers were
      increasing. At the core of the product is data so there was heavy data
      transformation and manipulation involved and they needed to make that
      process as fast as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this information in mind, I examined the existing platform, started
      documenting flaws and identifying strategies to tackle them. We settled to
      use Vue as their in-house team was more familiar with it. I bootstrapped
      the project, and within a few weeks the designated MVP which included a
      partial component library optimized for accessibility was ready.

      Usually, systems that require loads of data manipulation and all sorts of
      computations settle to perform these operations server-side. But since we
      were dealing with really huge data (reaching megabytes at times), the
      round trip time (RTT) was in high numbers which resulted in delayed
      updates. To tackle this, I had to implement a lot of the processing and
      manipulation logic on the frontend, leaving special computation work and
      business logic for the backend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, it's easy to go wrong and pollute data in these computations which
      made it clear that we needed solid assertion mechanisms so I created a
      bunch of fail-safe optimized utility libraries which implemented solid
      type-checks and validation techniques to ensure fast, yet accurate data
      diffing and transformation work to preserve the integrity of the
      information displayed and minimize runtime errors and unusability.
    </p>

    <p>
      After nine months of work, we were finally ready to go live and the beta
      version was launched. It not only met but exceeded the expectations and
      beat the previous version at speed, accessibility and reliabilty.
