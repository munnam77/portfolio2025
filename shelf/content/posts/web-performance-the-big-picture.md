As the web platform continues to evolve very quickly, new technologies and
development techniques spring up even more rapidly. It has become alarming how
many slow sites are on the web today, one of the reasons being the drastic shift
of the web from a document-centric platform to a much more dynamic application
platform — the web is more powerful than ever, making it possible for users to
get virtually any experience on the web — and that’s awesome, really.

However, the web really is getting _slower_. It’s quite unfortunate that a lot
of web teams and businesses just want a “magical solution” not realizing there’s
no one antidote to poor performance of sites; there’s no one tech or approach
that’s going to make websites or the web platform as a whole fast automagically,
which is why in my opinion, engineering teams should prioritize performance at
every phase of the [design sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_sprint)
for a product.

In this article, we’ll be talking about why web performance really matters. So,
let’s dive right in!

## Why Performance matters

In one word, performance is about your **users**. Users. That’s why performance
matters. You’re building a product for people to use it, right? Whether you’re
building your portfolio, a news site, or a more dynamic experience like
Facebook, you want people to use your stuff; and users in a lot of cases means
success, same way, success means profit if it’s a business!

However, for people to interact seamlessly with your application or website, it
has to be accessible. Note that “accessible” here is more about showing content
to your users quickly at least, and if possible, making the most basic feature
work. Diving deeper, optimizing performance for users means providing a great
**user experience** overall. Let’s see how doing this is of benefit to our
businesses and products.

### Web Performance meets User Experience

Now that we know a little about why performance matters, let’s talk more about
how great performance and poor performance impact user experience.

Great performance means great user experience; great user experience translates
to retaining users, and that means more users! You want people to go to your
site and do whatever the site was made for. If it’s an e-commerce site, you want
people to go there, sign up, and buy or sell stuff. If it’s a business, you want
users to use your product, talk about it, share it, bring more users, and get
more revenue. Performance plays a great role in this because:

If your site is slow to load or make the most basic feature possible to use,
your users get tired of waiting and discouraged. Nobody wants to spend the whole
day waiting for your site or app to load to be able to perform a task, because,
remember, it’s the world wide web: for the most part, there are alternatives to
your product, you have competitors. So, once a user thinks your platform would
to take too much of their time, they want to leave and go to another site that
offers close to or exactly what your site offers.

Also, in rare cases where there’s no alternative to your product, the users
either get frustrated up to the level they want to quit your platform totally,
or they just leave your site and go somewhere else, and that can be bad for
business.

Again, **poor performance means more cost for the users** — Yes, cost. We know
the web is becoming a
[mobile-dominant platform](http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet).
Mobile means movable — the users can take the web with them wherever they go,
and as such, they can’t determine network conditions or expect to get a certain
network quality in such situations. So, your user might have no choice other
than to access your site on a 2G network. If your site is not optimized for such
conditions, the user becomes increasingly tired of trying to access it because
of the time spent and the cost of trying subsequently over such conditions. Note
that “cost” also includes real cost for data plans.

_On the contrary…_

Great performance can be perceived as a site that delivers what matters quickly:
the user gets to your site, for example, a social networking app optimized for
poor network and hardware conditions — which of course requires deliberate
commitment by the engineering and product team as a whole at every process.
Imagine your user can view at least 10% of **relevant content** (useful-to-user
content) on your app (maybe text posts from friends without images), or the user
gets a very minimal version of your site on a poor network, take
[m.facebook.com](http://m.facebook.com) for example. That’s an awesome
experience because even if the user is engaged with <10% of your platform, it’s
much better than losing the user totally, which is less than, or sometimes 0%.
This way, the user can interact with your app, and of course, instills in the
mind of your users that your site is always a go-to no matter the network
condition. That makes better user experience and more profit for the business.

Let’s take a look quickly at some case-studies on how performance has either
impacted positively or negatively in conversion rates and revenue on products.

## Case Studies

**Where Performance Optimization has helped**

- [By reducing their load time to 3 seconds, Furniture retailer](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-154/insights-inspiration/case-studies/zitmaxx-wonen-building-faster-mobile-site-pagespeed-insights-test-my-site/),
  Zitmaxx Women saw conversion jump _50.2%_. Overall revenue from the mobile
  site also increased by _98.7%_.
- [Rebuilding Pinterest pages for performance resulted](https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7#.wwimdmkpp)
  in a 40% decrease in wait time, a _15%_ increase in SEO traffic and a _15%_
  increase in conversion rate to signup.
- [AliExpress saw a 10.5% increase in orders and a 27% increase in conversion for new customers](https://edge.akamai.com/ec/us/highlights/keynote-speakers.jsp#edge2016futureofcommercemodal)
  when they reduced load time by 36%.

**Where Poor Performance has affected the products**

- Financial Times added a one second delay to every page view and saw a _4.9%_
  drop in the number of articles users read over a 7 day window. A two-second
  delay resulted in a _4.4%_ drop, and a three second delay saw a _7.2%_ drop.
  [After twenty-eight days the two and three second variants both resulted in further drops in engagement](http://engineroom.ft.com/2016/04/04/a-faster-ft-com/).
- [According to research from Google's DoubleClick](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/),
  53% of visits to mobile sites are abandoned after 3 seconds.
- [DoubleClick by Google found 53% of mobile site visits were abandoned](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/)
  if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load.
- [TRAC Research found, in a survey of 300 companies](http://www.slideshare.net/KenGodskind/alertsitetrac),
  that the average revenue loss for an hour of downtime was
  $21,000. For the same set of companies, average revenue loss due to an hour of slow performance (defined as load times exceeding 4.4 seconds) was $4,100.
  Website slowdowns occurred ten times more often than outages.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, you have a better take on web performance, why your team should
consider it at every process of product design, and the benefits it holds for
your businesses and product. You’ve also seen from the case studies where poor
performance has led to losing users and less revenue. Stay tuned for the next
articles where I talk about the several factors affecting performance, including
strategies and patterns to tackle these problems.
